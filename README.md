The goal of this project is to help researchers to analyze traffic encapsulated in SSL or TLS. For details have a view into the [slides](./friTap.pdf).

This project was inspired by [SSL_Logger](https://github.com/google/ssl_logger ) and currently supports Android and Linux as well. More platforms will be added in future releases.
