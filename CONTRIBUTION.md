# CONTRIBUTION Guidlines

**currently we are refactoring the whole code - so if you want to add a contribution you might wait a little till we finished**

- each new SSL/TLS library should be implemented in its `<library-name>.ts` inside the assets folder.
- for each new library we want to build a ground truth so that we can ensure that the library is working at least when it is compiled by default
